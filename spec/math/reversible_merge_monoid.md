# Reversible Merge Monoid (3⊥+1)

The 3⊥+1 structure models an append-only ledger as a monoid. Elements support a merge operation (⊕) with an associated inverse enabling reversible merges. This spec sketches the algebraic laws that make the structure suitable for Φ-16, ensuring that history can be merged and audited without loss of information.
